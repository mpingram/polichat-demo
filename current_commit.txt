-- move magic color and spectrum cutoff values into config file
-- combine meter into UIElement component
-- simplify UIElement / child component interaction

TODO: performance is still iffy, especially when max is a large int.
	Will need to think about ways to remove work from react's
	rendering engine as much as possible.
